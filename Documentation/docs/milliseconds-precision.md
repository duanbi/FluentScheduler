The aim of the library is ease of use and flexibility and not millisecond precision. You might experience tenths of milliseconds added between runs of a fluent schedule, but such accumulation is not present on [cron schedules](https://fluentscheduler.github.io/cron-expressions).

The lowest interval you can set for a schedule is one second.
